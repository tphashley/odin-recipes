        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the whole urad dal and kidney beans and scrub them with your hands; drain the water and repeat this process a few times.</li>
            <li>Cover the lentils and beans with a few inches of cold water. Add the baking soda. Soak for 8 hours (or overnight). Drain and rinse several times, until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Cook the lentils and beans. Transfer them to a medium saucepan and cover with 1 to 2 inches of water and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. Cover and bring to a boil, skimming off the foam that rises to the surface once it starts to boil.
                <p>Boil uncovered for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes until the beans and lentils are very soft. If the water evaporates during simmering, add freshly boiled water as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Fit a bowl underneath a colander and drain the lentils and beans, saving the cooking liquid. Measure out the cooking liquid and add enough water to make 3 1/2 cups (4 cups for a slightly looser dal). Mash the lentils and beans with a potato masher, fork, or large wooden spoon. Set both aside for now.</li>
            <li>Start cooking the dal. Heat the 1 ½ tablespoons oil in a deep saute pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the cinnamon stick, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, and cumin seeds. Cook for 45 to 60 seconds, swirling the pan frequently, until aromatic and sizzling.</li>
            <li>Add the onions with a pinch or two of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add in a few splashes of water towards the end to pick up the fond and to prevent them from getting too brown.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 1 minute, tossing frequently. Add the tomato paste, nutmeg, coriander, red chile powder, 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Stir frequently for 60 to 90 seconds. Add the tomatoes and their juices, and cook until broken down and softened, 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the bean liquid/water mixture and scrape up any browned bits to deglaze the pan. Add the mashed lentils and beans, and stir well.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Stir every 10 minutes for at least 60 minutes, or up to 80 minutes (slow cooking enhances the flavors and makes it extremely creamy). During simmering, add more freshly boiled water, as needed, if it looks like it’s drying up.</li>
            <li>Pour in the cashew cream or coconut milk and simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Add in the cilantro and lemon juice and season to taste with salt. If it’s a bit too acidic for your taste, add the sugar. Fish out the cinnamon stick and bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Make the tadka. Heat the vegan butter in a medium frying pan on the stove over medium high heat. Once melted, add the ginger (if using) and cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently. Crush the kasoori methi with your hands into the dal, and add the garam masala and red chile powder. Cook for another 30 seconds, swirling the pan frequently. Pour the tadka over the dal and serve.</li>
